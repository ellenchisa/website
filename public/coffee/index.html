       <p> You found the secret page! (Okay, not that secret). For a year or two, this was a /mentoring page, part of a distributed mentorship movement. It was complicated, and <a href="https://themanual.org/read/issues/4/diana-kimball/article">this update</a> summarizes some of the reasons I moved the page. From <a href="https://medium.com/thelist/have-some-coffee-9e468d958e77">my own perspective</a>, I thought it made the most sense to move it to /coffee.</p> 

       <p> If you're strictly looking for advice/help on getting into Product Management, please book my time through <a href="https://clarity.fm/ellenchisa">Clarity.fm</a> instead. I'll happily prepare for any specific questions you have, or prepare a mock PM interview. If this is cost prohibitive, feel free to <a href="mailto:ellen@ellenchisa.com">email me</a> and we can work something out.</p>

       <p>Other than that, I'm always up for making new friends. A great option is joining me for something I already do! I spend a decent amount of time climbing at Brooklyn Boulders in Somerville (including every Tuesday evening) and I go to Sara's SoulCycle class in Beacon Hill at 8:30am on Monday and Wednesday. Feel free to check in with me to make sure I'll be there. That not good? If you want to do coffee, send me an email including some of the things you'd like to talk about! We don't have to stick to the script, but I'd love to know what's on your mind. You can reach me at <a href="mailto:coffee@ellenchisa.com">coffee@ellenchisa.com</a>.</p>
