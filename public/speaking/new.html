                <p><a href="https://www.ellenchisa.com">Ellen Chisa</a> speaks about startups, software development, and leadership. You can read about her talk development process on the <a href="http://www.5050pledge.com/ellen-chisa/">50/50 pledge</a> or contact her for bookings: <a href="mailto:ellen.chisa@gmail.com">ellen.chisa@gmail.com</a>.

                <p>Talks Ellen gives frequently are:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Beyond Metrics: Making Product decisions is a lot more than metrics. This talk walks through four ways to make product decisions in a startup: quantiative, qualitative, vision, and team input.</li>

                <li>Continued Learning In Product Management: Lots of content exists for "how to get into Product Management." A lot less exists for "How do I get better at Product Management?" This talk walks through how to assess where you are as a PM, what to learn next, and how to learn it. (And yes, it answers the two most popular questions: "do I need an engineering degree?" and "do I need an MBA?")</li>

                <li>Courses: Ellen has also developed a full length <a href="https://blog.ellenchisa.com/pm-olin-syllabus-47720abef015">Product course for engineers</a> and revised an interface deisgn course for engineers at <a href="http://www.olin.edu">Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering</a>.</li>
                </ul>
