                <p> I speak regularly on product, leadership, and career. If I'd be a good fit your event, you can reach me at <a href="mailto:bookings@ellenchisa.com">bookings@ellenchisa.com</a>. I care deeply about speaking at events that include underrepresented groups in technology as both speakers and attendees.</p> 

                <h3>Preferred Talks</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Continued Learning In Product Management</b>: Lots of content exists for "how to get into Product Management." A lot less exists for "How do I get better at Product Management?" This talk walks through how to assess where you are as a PM, what to learn next, and how to learn it. (And yes, it answers the two most popular questions: "do I need an engineering degree?" and "do I need an MBA?")</li><br>
                    <li><b>Beyond Metrics</b>: Making Product decisions is a lot more than metrics. This talk walks through four ways to make product decisions: quantiative, qualitative, vision, and team input.</li>
                    <li> If you are looking for something else, we can also discuss a custom talk for your group. Some other talks I've given in the past are listed below. If you'rd like a video sample of my speaking, please email me directly. I also shared my prep process it with the <a href="http://www.5050pledge.com/ellen-chisa/">50/50 pledge</a>.
