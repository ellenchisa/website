                <p><a href="https://www.ellenchisa.com">Ellen Chisa</a> speaks about startups, software development, and leadership. You can read about her talk development process on the <a href="http://www.5050pledge.com/ellen-chisa/">50/50 pledge</a> or contact her for bookings: <a href="mailto:ellen.chisa@gmail.com">ellen.chisa@gmail.com</a>.

                <p>Current talks:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Programming in Production: Programming directly in production is the tightest possible development loop, with immediate feedback which brings a sense of joy to programming. But it also raises a visceral fear of breaking production traffic, losing data and transactions, and harming users. This talk discusses how we could potentially create an environment for safe, live coding of backend systems.</li>

                <li>Can Accidental Complexity be Tamed?: Backends are simple concepts. We need to receive data, process it, store it, and send data to other systems. Why do we build them with massive complex systems comprising Kubernetes, Docker, Git, load balancers, dozens of AWS services, SQL, NoSQL, Kafka, Unix, GraphQL, gRPC, npm, Heroku, DNS, memcached, and Nginx. Complex backends can be built with much simpler tools, and this talk discusses how that might happen.</li>

                <li>Courses: Ellen has also developed a full length <a href="https://blog.ellenchisa.com/pm-olin-syllabus-47720abef015">Product course for engineers</a> and revised an interface design course for engineers at <a href="http://www.olin.edu">Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering</a>. Historically she spoke about learning in product, balancing post PMF roadmaps, and thinking about vision vs. management for product leadership.</li>
