                <h2> Backer Tools </h2>
                    <p> We re-designed the Activity Feed and Backer History. Our goal was to help people stay up to date with the projects that they'd already backed. A big part of Kickstarter is keeping track of the creative process, which happens during project updates. We wanted to make it easier for backers to skim their activity feed and find the project updates that they were interested in.</p>
                    <p> Additionally, we wanted to overhaul the backer history page. That page was originally just a flat list of transactions. We wanted to give backers the option to sort the pledges that they'd made. We also added a "Got it!" column to help backers keep track of when they receive their rewards for projects.</p>
