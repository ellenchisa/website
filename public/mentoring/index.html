		<p> /mentoring is a distributed mentorship movement. You can read more by going to <a href="http://mentoring.is">mentoring.is</a> or you can dive right in on <a href="https://github.com/dianakimball/mentoring">Github.</a><br></p>

				<p> Given all that's going on in my life right now, I'm currently unable to take on anything new. Please check back in a month or so. Thanks!<p>

				<p> Not everyone is comfortable asking for help without an invitation. This is that invitation! I love meeting interesting people, and I think inspiration and mentorship can come from everywhere. I've learned a lot from talking to people. </p>

				<p> Some quick bullet points on what I've done: </p>
				<ul> 
					<li>I'm a Product Manager at Kickstarter.</li>
					<li>I teach and write about Product Management.</li>
					<li>I used to be a Program Manager at Microsoft, so I went from a huge company to a pretty small one.</li>
					<li>I left Microsoft without having another job lined up.</li>
					<li>I'm a trustee (and former Dean) of the Awesome Foundation. </li>
					<li>I went to Olin College when it was still "risky" to go there. </li>
					<li>I took a year off from Olin to co-found Alight Learning. It didn't work out. </li>
				</ul>

				<p> Interested? Send me an email including: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Past: What's your story? How'd you get where you are?</li>
					<li>Present: How'd you find me? How do you think I (in particular) can help?</li>
					<li>Future: What are you looking forward to most in the next month?</li>
				</ul>

				<p> If you're looking for help getting into Product Management, I'd suggest booking my time through <a href="https://clarity.fm/ellenchisa">Clarity.fm</a> instead. I'll happily prepare for any specific questions you have, or prepare a mock PM interview. If this is cost prohibitive, feel free to email me and we can work something out.</p>

				<p> My email address is ellen dot chisa at gmail dot com. </p>
