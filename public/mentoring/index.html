			<h2> So what is /mentoring? </h2>
				
			<p> It's a distributed mentorship movmement! You can read more by going to <a href="http://mentoring.is">mentoring.is</a>, or you can dive right in on <a href="https://github.com/dianakimball/mentoring">Github.</a></p>

			<p> I decided to take part because I've had fantastic mentors throughout my life. I think a lot of people miss out because they're afraid to ask for help, so I wanted to make it really easy to ask me. It's also a little selfish - I love meeting interesting people, and I think inspiration and mentorship can come from everywhere! Hopefully we'll be able to learn from each other. </p><br>

			<h2> A few things I've done: </h2>
			<ul> 
				<li>I'm a Product Manager at Kickstarter.</li>
				<li>I left my last job without having another job lined up.</li>
				<li>I was a Program Manager at Microsoft, so I went from a huge company to a pretty small one.</li>
				<li>I'm a trustee (and former Dean) of the Awesome Foundation. </li>
				<li>I went to Olin College when it was still "risky" to go there. </li>
				<li>I took a year off from Olin to co-found Alight Learning. It didn't work out. </li>
				<li>I've kept my blog (on and off) since 2008.</li>
			</ul><br>

			<h2> Interested? Send me an email including: </h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Past: What's your story? How'd you get where you are?</li>
				<li>Present: How'd you find me? How do you think I can help?</li>
				<li>Future: What are you looking forward to most in the next month?</li>
