				<p> Hello! You can find me around the internet or in real life, but this is my story so far.</p>

				<p> Right now, I'm the Director of Product Management at <a href="http://www.blade.net">Blade</a>. We're working on a new travel company. I love to travel - my last trip was to Wilkes-Barre, PA for my fiancee's high school reunion. My next trip is to Louisville and Detroit to visit family. Interested in working with us? We're <a href="http://www.blade.net/jobs">hiring.</a> I'm never bored.</p>

				<p> In May, I completed the RC (first year) at Harvard Business School! I wrote down <a href="https://medium.com/thelist/what-s-one-thing-you-ve-learned-at-harvard-business-school-that-blew-your-mind-fdea346a0422">one key lesson from each class<a/>. I'm on leave right now, but I'll go back and finish someday - probably around the same time I decide to start my own company.</p>

				<p>Last Spring, I taught a seminar in Product Management at <a href="http://www.olin.edu"> Olin College</a>. I've made <a href="http://blog.ellenchisa.com/2015/02/05/pmolin-syllabus/">my syllabus</a> and every lesson available. I'm interested in teaching it again: if you want it for your company or university, please <a href="mailto:ellen.chisa@gmail.com?Subject=Product%20Management%20Class" target="_top">email me</a>.</p>

			<div id="books">
				<p>I love reading. Right now I'm reading <a href="{{last_book.link}}">{{last_book.title}}</a> by {{last_book.author}}. Some other things I enjoy are <a href="http://www.ellenchisa.com/writing">writing</a>, SCUBA Diving, and the Twilight Zone pinball machine. I've heard the Clover Labs in Central Square has one, and I'm always up for a game.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="kickstarter">
				<p>I used to work as a Product Manager at Kickstarter. I worked on <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/discover/advanced"> a new set of Discovery tools</a> amongst other things. A big part of working at Kickstarter is getting to see (and support!) creative projects. Here are a few projects I recently backed:</p>

					</a>
				</div>
				{{/each}}

			<div id="awesome">
				<p>I was a Dean and Trustee of the Awesome Foundation for three years. If you're interested in learning more about the it, you should check out <a href="http://creativemornings.com/talks/awesome-foundation">this talk</a> that I gave with <a href="http://www.nicolebelee.com">Nikki Lee</a> at Creative Mornings. The talk itself is 17 minutes, and the rest is Q&amp;A. </p>

				<p>I used to live in Seattle, where I was a Program Manager at Microsoft. I worked on <a href="http://blogs.office.com/b/office-next/archive/2012/10/29/introducing-the-new-office-on-windows-phone-8.aspx"> Office for Windows Phone 8</a>. I also worked on something that I still affectionately refer to as "The Oompa Loompas" and on PowerPoint Broadcast for Symbian.<a href="http://blog.ellenchisa.com/2013/12/17/my-microsoft-experience-13/"> I wrote a longer essay on my time at Microsoft.</a></p>

				<p>Before that, I graduated from Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering with a B.S. in Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering. My senior capstone project at Olin was studying "transitioners" - people who were graduating from college and going to work for the first time. My team designed an application called Sundrop: Saving for a Sunny Day, meant to encourage impulse saving. One of my favorite parts of the application was the "Not Starbucks" feature.</p>

				<p> At one point, I took a Leave of Absence from Olin. While on leave I co-founded Alight Learning with five of my friends. We attempted to design learning management software from pedagogical principles, rather than automating the existing student-teacher workflow.</p>

				<p> I grew up in Michigan. I attended the International Academy for High School, which at the time was the only all-public all-International Baccalaurate school in North America. I'm still a huge fan of the IB curriculum. I was also a member of FIRST Robotics Team 469. </p>

				<p> Since this <i>is</i> the internet, here is a video of my cat:</p>

				<p> Still reading? I enjoy meeting new people! I'm taking a break for now, but you can email me at ellen.chisa@gmail.com and we can figure out a time for sometime in 2016.</p>
