				<p> Hello! You can find me around the internet or in real life, but this is my story so far.</p>

				<p> I'm the VP of Product at <a href="http://www.lolatravel.com">Lola</a>. Lola is the best way to plan, book, and manage your travel. We just launched <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1103890283&mt=8">in the app store</a>, and you should try it out (iOS only for now). As you might guess, I love to travel. I'm headed to Belgium at the end of May to spend a week on the <a href="http://www.mselisabeth.be/p%C3%A9niche-d-h%C3%B4tes/">MS Elisabeth</a> with my family. In addition to travel, I love reading. Luckily long plane rides are good for that. Right now I'm reading <a href="{{last_book.link}}">{{last_book.title}}</a> by {{last_book.author}}. If you're interested in working with our team at Lola, check if we're <a href="http://www.lolatravel.com/jobs">hiring.</a></p>

				<p>Before Lola, I worked as a Product Manager at Kickstarter and lived in Brooklyn. I worked on <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/discover/advanced"> a new set of Discovery tools</a> amongst other things. A big part of working at Kickstarter is getting to see (and support!) creative projects. Here are a few projects I recently backed:</p>

			<p>In addition to making cool products, I really care about learning. In May of 2015, I completed the RC (first year) at Harvard Business School. I wrote down <a href="https://medium.com/thelist/what-s-one-thing-you-ve-learned-at-harvard-business-school-that-blew-your-mind-fdea346a0422">one key lesson from each class</a>. I'm still on leave right now, but I'll probably go back and finish someday.</p>

			<p>My love of learning spills over into <a href="https://www.ellenchisa.com/teaching">teaching</a>. I recently launched a <a href="http://skl.sh/1TWEQNn">PM class on Skillshare</a>, based on <a href="http://blog.ellenchisa.com/2014/01/28/want-to-be-a-pm-do-a-project/">my popular blog post</a> on learning PM. I also taught a seminar in Product Management at <a href="http://www.olin.edu"> Olin College</a>. I've made <a href="http://blog.ellenchisa.com/2015/02/05/pmolin-syllabus/">my syllabus</a> and every lesson available. I'm interested in teaching it again: if you want it for your company or university, please <a href="mailto:ellen.chisa@gmail.com?Subject=Product%20Management%20Class" target="_top">email me</a>.</p></p>

			<p>A few other things I enjoy are <a href="http://www.ellenchisa.com/writing">writing</a>, SCUBA Diving, and the Twilight Zone pinball machine.</p>

				<p>Going back further, I was a Dean and Trustee of the Awesome Foundation for three years. If you're interested in learning more about the it, you should check out <a href="http://creativemornings.com/talks/awesome-foundation">this talk</a> that I gave with <a href="http://www.nicolebelee.com">Nikki Lee</a> at Creative Mornings. The talk itself is 17 minutes, and the rest is Q&amp;A. </p>

				<p>At one point, I lived in Seattle, where I was a Program Manager at Microsoft. I worked on <a href="http://blogs.office.com/b/office-next/archive/2012/10/29/introducing-the-new-office-on-windows-phone-8.aspx"> Office for Windows Phone 8</a>. I also worked on something that I still affectionately refer to as "The Oompa Loompas" and on PowerPoint Broadcast for Symbian.<a href="http://blog.ellenchisa.com/2013/12/17/my-microsoft-experience-13/"> I wrote a longer essay on my time at Microsoft.</a></p>

				<p>Before that, I graduated from Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering with a B.S. in Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering. My senior capstone project at Olin was studying "transitioners" - people who were graduating from college and going to work for the first time. My team designed an application called Sundrop: Saving for a Sunny Day, meant to encourage impulse saving. One of my favorite parts of the application was the "Not Starbucks" feature.</p>

				<p> During what would have been my junior year, I took a Leave of Absence from Olin. While on leave I co-founded Alight Learning with five of my friends. We attempted to design learning management software from pedagogical principles, rather than automating the existing student-teacher workflow.</p>

				<p> I grew up in Michigan. I attended the International Academy for High School, which at the time was the only all-public all-International Baccalaurate school in North America. I'm still a huge fan of the IB curriculum. I was also a member of FIRST Robotics Team 469. </p>

				<p> Since this <i>is</i> the internet, here is a video of my cat:</p>

				<p> Still reading? Now you know (almost) my entire life story. I do enjoy meeting new people! You can read the <a href="https://www.ellenchisa.com/coffee">coffee page</a> or email me at ellen.chisa@gmail.com.</p>
