			<div id="intro">
				<p> Hello! You can find me around the internet or in real life, but this is my story so far. I'm in my first year at Harvard Business School. It was a difficult decision, and here are my<a href="http://blog.ellenchisa.com/2014/04/19/some-news-hbs/"> reasons for going</a>. It's been up and down, and I've been sharing what I've learned along the way <a href="http://blog.ellenchisa.com/category/hbs/"> here</a>. I really miss making things, so I've been working on a side project with<a href="http://www.tmrudick.com"> Tom</a>. We'll announce it soon. By the end of my time at HBS, I want to have started my own company.

			<div id="books">
				<p>I'm disappointed that I no longer have as much time to read. Right now I'm reading <a href="{{last_book.link}}">{{last_book.title}}</a> by {{last_book.author}}. My New Year's Resolution was to commit something to Github everyday. I gave up, but I did finish a <a href="http://www.ellenchisa.com/books/">visualization of what I've read so far</a>. You can fork it on Github to make your own. Some other things I enjoy are <a href="http://www.ellenchisa.com/writing">writing</a>, SCUBA Diving, and the Twilight Zone pinball machine.</p>

			<div id="kickstarter">
				<p>My last job before this was as a Product Manager at Kickstarter. I worked on <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/discover/advanced"> a new set of Discovery tools</a> amongst other things. A big part of working at Kickstarter is getting to see (and support!) creative projects. Here are a few projects I recently backed:</p>

			<div id="awesome">
				<p>I was a Dean and Trustee of the Awesome Foundation for three years. If you're interested in learning more about the it, you should check out <a href="http://creativemornings.com/talks/awesome-foundation">this talk</a> that I gave with <a href="http://www.nicolebelee.com">Nikki Lee</a> at Creative Mornings. The talk itself is 17 minutes, and the rest is Q&amp;A. </p>

				<p>I used to live in Seattle, where I was a Program Manager at Microsoft. I worked on <a href="http://blogs.office.com/b/office-next/archive/2012/10/29/introducing-the-new-office-on-windows-phone-8.aspx"> Office for Windows Phone 8</a>. I also worked on something that I still affectionately refer to as "The Oompa Loompas" and on PowerPoint Broadcast for Symbian.<a href="http://blog.ellenchisa.com/2013/12/17/my-microsoft-experience-13/"> I wrote a longer essay on my time at Microsoft.</a></p>

				<p>Before that, I graduated from Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering with a B.S. in Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering. My senior capstone project at Olin was studying "transitioners" - people who were graduating from college and going to work for the first time. My team designed an application called Sundrop: Saving for a Sunny Day, meant to encourage impulse saving. One of my favorite parts of the application was the "Not Starbucks" feature.</p>

				<p> At one point, I took a Leave of Absence from Olin. While on leave I co-founded Alight Learning with five of my friends. We attempted to design learning management software from pedagogical principles, rather than automating the existing student-teacher workflow.</p>

				<p> I grew up in Michigan. I attended the International Academy for High School, which at the time was the only all-public all-International Baccalaurate school in North America. I'm still a huge fan of the IB curriculum. I was also a member of FIRST Robotics Team 469. </p>

				<p> Since this <i>is</i> the internet, here is a video of my cat:</p>

				<p> Still reading? I enjoy meeting new people! If you're in Boston, we could grab coffee (be forewarned, I'll ask you to meet me at 7am). You can email me at ellen.chisa@gmail.com.</p>
